# iTalki 课堂结构指南

## 课堂时间分配（30 分钟）

```
0-3 min    复习上节课错误
3-15 min   工作场景角色扮演（核心）
15-20 min  错误整理
20-25 min  下节课准备
25-30 min  发音练习
```

---

## 各环节详细说明

### 1. 复习上节课错误（0-3 分钟）

**做什么：**
- 老师读你上次的错误句，你说正确版本
- 或者老师说正确句的开头，你补全

**示例：**
- 老师："Last time you said 'I have work on this'. What's the correct version?"
- 你："I have been working on this."

---

### 2. 工作场景角色扮演（3-15 分钟）

**核心原则：老师不需要懂技术**

老师扮演"不懂技术的同事/PM/老板"，这正是真实场景——你经常需要向非技术人员解释技术问题。

**场景轮换表（每周换一个主题）：**

| 周次 | 场景 | 你要练习的能力 |
|------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Daily Standup | 简洁汇报进度 |
| 2 | Explaining a Bug | 用简单语言描述技术问题 |
| 3 | Requirement Clarification | 提问和确认需求 |
| 4 | Code Review Feedback | 礼貌地给出建议 |
| 5 | Asking for Help | 清楚描述问题并请求帮助 |
| 6 | Explaining Delay | 解释延期原因并提出方案 |
| 7 | Disagreeing Politely | 表达不同意见 |
| 8 | 复习周 | 重新练习最弱的场景 |

**老师可以问的通用问题（发给老师）：**

```
Universal questions you can ask me (no technical knowledge needed):

1. What's the problem in one sentence?
2. Who is affected? How bad is it?
3. When did it start?
4. What have you tried so far?
5. What do you need from me/the team?
6. When do you think it will be fixed?
7. Can you explain it in simpler terms?
8. What's the next step?
```

---

### 3. 错误整理（15-20 分钟）

**做什么：**
- 和老师一起整理刚才的 Top 5 错误句
- 老师写下：错误版 → 正确版
- 你每句重复 3 遍

**格式：**
```
❌ I have mass test for the bug.
✅ I have tested the bug extensively.

❌ The page is not render correct.
✅ The page is not rendering correctly.
```

---

### 4. 下节课准备（20-25 分钟）

**做什么：**
- 你告诉老师下节课想练哪个场景
- 老师给你 3 个正确句型，课后练习用

**示例：**
```
你：Next class I want to practice "asking for help".
老师给你的句型：
1. "Do you have a minute? I'm running into an issue."
2. "I've tried X, but it's not working. Any ideas?"
3. "Would you mind taking a look at this with me?"
```

---

### 5. 发音练习（25-30 分钟）

**做什么：**
- 课前准备 10 个词（5 个技术词汇 + 5 个之前错的词）
- 老师逐个纠正发音，特别注意重音位置

**发给老师的话：**
```
For the last 5 minutes, I'd like to practice pronunciation.
Here are 10 words I want to work on:
[你的词汇列表]

Please:
1. Listen to me say each word
2. Correct my pronunciation immediately
3. Tell me where the stress should be
```

## 给老师的完整说明（课前发送）

```
Hi [Teacher's name],

I'd like to structure our classes to help me improve faster.
Here's what I'm thinking:

CLASS STRUCTURE (30 minutes):
- 0-3 min: Review my mistakes from last class
- 3-15 min: Role-play (you play a non-technical colleague, I explain things)
- 15-20 min: Error correction (write down my top 5 mistakes)
- 20-25 min: Prepare for next class (give me 3 sentences to practice)
- 25-30 min: Pronunciation practice (10 words)

IMPORTANT:
- You don't need to understand technical content
- Just help me express ideas clearly and naturally
- Please correct my errors immediately
- Focus on: grammar, word choice, pronunciation

Questions you can ask me during role-play:
1. What's the problem?
2. Who is affected?
3. What do you need from me?
4. When can it be fixed?
5. Can you explain it more simply?

I'll prepare materials before each class.

Thank you!
```
