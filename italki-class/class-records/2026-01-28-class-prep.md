## Key Expressions（课前熟读 3 遍）

### 开场
> "So, you know how our website loads really fast at first? That's because the server sends a 'snapshot' of the page."

### 用干花类比解释
> "Think of it like a dried flower. It looks like a real flower, but it can't respond to touch. Hydration is like adding water to bring it back to life - making the buttons actually clickable."

### 解释影响
> "During that brief moment, users see the page but can't interact. It usually takes less than a second."

### 回答"是 bug 吗"
> "It's not a bug - it's how modern websites work. But we can optimize it to make that moment shorter."

### 如果老板要求更简单的解释
> "The page shows up fast, but it needs a moment to 'wake up' before buttons work. We can make that moment shorter."

Hi,

【SCENARIO】
You are my boss (non-technical). Users complained that "buttons don't work

2. Why are users complaining about buttons not working?
3. How long does this take? Is it noticeable?
4. Can we fix it? What do you need?
5. Can you explain it in simpler terms?

【REVIEW FROM LAST CLASS】
Please ask me to correct these sentences:
- ❌ "I'm not familiar this" → What word is missing?
- ❌ "I need keep practicing" → What word is missing?
- ❌ "speak an American accent" → What word is missing?

【PRONUNCIATION PRACTICE (last 5 min)】
Please help me practice these 10 words:
1. analyze
2. familiar
3. recommend
4. unfortunately
